## Artist Statement

I am an emerging artist with a First class Honours degree in Fine Art (2012) My practice is a vehicle for questioning and navigating personal mythology.

Found images are the sketch that launch new ideas in collage. Selected images are juxta-posed with re-contexturalised art historical references to drive new narratives.

My creative aim is to riff on themes of relationships and the human condition, often evoking  both drama and a playfully noire humour.

My pursuit is to convey a deeper meaning beyond the sum of the subverted images and assembled fragments. Extending beyond “paper art”, my practice crosses boundaries erected around collage, drawing, painting and sculpture to create fresh hybrid combines.  All my pieces have a female voice, a challenging narrative and often a dark tension.
